Three.js is a popular library for creating 3D content on the web. It is built on top of WebGL and allows for a higher level of abstraction. You can find the documentation [here](https://threejs.org/docs/).

WebGL Fundamentals is a great resource for learning the basics of WebGL. You can find it [here](https://webglfundamentals.org/). Here is also russian version of this site: [here](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/ru/).

You have to remember that WebGL is a low-level API, and it can be quite complex to work with. Three.js is a great way to get started with 3D graphics on the web, but it is also important to understand the underlying technology. 
If you are interested in learning more about WebGL, I would recommend checking out the book [WebGL Programming Guide](https://www.amazon.com/WebGL-Programming-Guide-Interactive-Graphics/dp/0321902920).
It's okay if you don't want to dive deep into WebGL, you can easily start with Three.js courses on Udemy. For example - [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/threejs-tutorials/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING).
